# 🎯 Guess the Number  

This is my **second Python project** — a simple and fun **number guessing game**.  
The computer generates a random number, and the player has to guess it correctly.  
With each attempt, the game provides hints whether the guess is **too high** or **too low**, until the correct number is guessed.

## 🚀 Features
- Random number generation using Python’s `random` module  
- Interactive user input
